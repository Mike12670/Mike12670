- Hi, I’m @Mike12670
- I’m interested in networking code such as server-client connections, configuring routers/switches and other internetworking topics, video game development, 
Java, various C languages, web languages, graphic design, and music composing.
- I’m looking to collaborate on video games.
- My email address is gmf3312@gmail.com.

I have written two video games, one called Starcaster and one called Super Dig Man Deluxe, and they're both fairly small projects that I coded myself; I drew a lot of the
sprites for both games but got some help from outside sources. I wrote all thge music for both games. I put both games on Steam but have since taken them down due to a lack
of popularity and a handful of glitches in the games. I am proud of Starcaster because it uses server/client connections to allow multiplayer. I made a total of $149 from
Starcaster,  and the other game was free. I still to this day write small video games like Snake in my free time for fun. They aren't as challenging, but it gets my mind 
reeling over programming and that I love. I still write music for fun too, but graphic design I only do when necessary as it isn't my forte. I plan on putting the small 
video games I write here on Github as soon as I finish one; I only got rid of the old projects because I had to get a new computer (my old one broke down without warning
and I didn't back up the files).
